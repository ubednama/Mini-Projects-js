# Circle Game

The Circle Game is a simple interactive game where circles are generated on the screen based on user taps implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Each tap generates a circle with a random radius is generated at the tapped position
   - Tapping again generates a second circle with another random radius.

   - If the user taps a third time, both circles disappear from the screen.
   - After the circles disappear, a new circle is generated on the next tap.

- **Intersection Check**:
   - When there are two circles on the screen, the game checks if they are intersecting or not.
   - If the circles intersect, a message is displayed indicating their intersection status.

## Implementation Details:
- Circles are generated dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
- Intersection between circles is calculated using geometric algorithms in JavaScript.
