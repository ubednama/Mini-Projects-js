# Circle Game

The Circle Game is a simple interactive game where circles are generated on the screen based on user taps implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

   - **Gameplay:**
      - Each tap generates a circle with a random radius at the tapped position.
      - Only two circles are allowed on the screen at a time.
      - If the user taps a third time, both circles disappear from the screen. A new circle is then generated on the next tap.
   - **Intersection Check:**
      - When two circles are present on the screen, the game checks if they intersect.
      - If the circles intersect, a message is displayed indicating their intersection status.

## Implementation Details:
- Circles are generated dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
- Intersection between circles is calculated using geometric algorithms in JavaScript.
