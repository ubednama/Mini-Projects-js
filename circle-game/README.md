# Circle Game

The Circle Game is a simple interactive game where circles are generated on the screen based on user taps. Each tap generates a circle with a random radius. The game follows the following rules:

1. **Generating Circles**: 
   - When the user taps on the screen, a circle with a random radius is generated at the tapped position.
   - Tapping again generates a second circle with another random radius.

2. **Clearing Circles**:
   - If the user taps a third time, both circles disappear from the screen.
   - After the circles disappear, a new circle is generated on the next tap.

3. **Intersection Check**:
   - When there are two circles on the screen, the game checks if they are intersecting or not.
   - If the circles intersect, a message is displayed indicating their intersection status.

## Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Play:
1. Open the game in a web browser.
2. Tap anywhere on the screen to generate a circle.
3. Tap again to generate a second circle.
4. Tap a third time to clear both circles and generate a new one.
5. Enjoy creating and interacting with the circles!

## Implementation Details:
- The game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Circles are generated dynamically using JavaScript DOM manipulation.
- Intersection between circles is calculated using geometric algorithms in JavaScript.
